# Dynamic-Cubemaps

This is a graphics application I wrote as a final for my graphics class in Spring 2016. It's a standalone demo of a dynamic cubemap, and features reflection, refraction, and skyboxing. 

[View the project website](https://khongton.github.io/Dynamic-Cubemaps/) to see the graphics techniques that were used in the making of this project.
